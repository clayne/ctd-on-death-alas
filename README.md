A mod for [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim][Skyrim] to quit the game when health
reaches zero.


## Requirements

- [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim][Skyrim]


## Installation

- Use your mod manager of choice, [Mod Organizer 2] is recommended.


## Known Issues

- This technically doesn't _crash_ to desktop, it exits gently using an
  [existing function of the game scripting language][QuitGame].


## TODO

- Turn it into a [SKSE] plugin to make the process actually crash, by trying
  to access an invalid memory address, or employing more advanced techniques.


## Credits

- [u/EuphoricKnave][#2] for the idea.
